# Project Submission

*Project Title:* Jenkison Sea Life  
*Submitted by:* Eze Kelechi Solomon  

This zip file contains *both the source code and the compiled (built) code* for the React project, along with additional supporting materials.

## Contents

- *Source Code*  
  Located in:  
  - src/ → React components and application logic  
  - public/ → static assets (images, icons, etc.)  
  - package.json & package-lock.json → project dependencies and scripts  
  - node_modules/ → all installed project dependencies (included for convenience)

- *Compiled (Built) Code*  
  Located in:  
  - dist/ or build/ (depending on setup) → production-ready, compiled application generated using npm run build

- *Additional Files*  
  - *Project Report* (.docx format) → includes acknowledgment, project synopsis, analysis, and additional details about the development process  
  - *Video Recording* → a screen capture/video walkthrough demonstrating the website in action

## Notes

- Since node_modules/ is included, you can run the project directly without needing to install dependencies — but if needed, you can still run npm install to refresh the environment.  
- The compiled code is fully generated and ready for deployment.
